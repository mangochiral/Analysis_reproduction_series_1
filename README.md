# Analysis_reproduction_series_1
Here I am trying to reproduce already published papers from the past. I started off with one the paper pertaining to T Cell exhaustion biology, the authors try to understand the difference between memory cells Tmem and exhausted TEX chromatin landscape underlying a distinct gene expression program, the how histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs) mediates this state. 

To run the code you can refer to the RMD and source the supplementary code to run it.
Data was extracted GEO GSE285248 (RNA-seq) and GSE285245 (CUT&RUN).

All the library version info is present in the PDF file.
